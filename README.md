# gxt-app

The application is written as the test work.

Implemented in java using GXT library on the client and server to use Spring Framevork.

The application allows you to move the lines from the left list to the right tree view.

The interface is clear and convenient displaced. It can be used as Drag-n-Drop, buttons and double-click.

### Need to do 
- whole refactoring (GxtappEntryPoint.class is tooooo fat and have HIGH Coupling)
- resolve the issue of exceptions (correct throwing & catching)
- ...?
